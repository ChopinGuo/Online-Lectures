 abstract = {This accessible book provides an introduction to the analysis and design of dynamic multiagent networks. Such networks are of great interest in a wide range of areas in science and engineering, including: mobile sensor networks, distributed robotics such as formation flying and swarming, quantum networks, networked economics, biological synchronization, and social networks. Focusing on graph theoretic methods for the analysis and synthesis of dynamic multiagent networks, the book presents a powerful new formalism and set of tools for networked systems.The book's three sections look at foundations, multiagent networks, and networks as systems. The authors give an overview of important ideas from graph theory, followed by a detailed account of the agreement protocol and its various extensions, including the behavior of the protocol over undirected, directed, switching, and random networks. They cover topics such as formation control, coverage, distributed estimation, social networks, and games over networks. And they explore intriguing aspects of viewing networks as systems, by making these networks amenable to control-theoretic analysis and automatic synthesis, by monitoring their dynamic evolution, and by examining higher-order interaction models in terms of simplicial complexes and their applications.The book will interest graduate students working in systems and control, as well as in computer science and robotics. It will be a standard reference for researchers seeking a self-contained account of system-theoretic aspects of multiagent networks and their wide-ranging applications.This book has been adopted as a textbook at the following universities:University of Stuttgart, GermanyRoyal Institute of Technology, SwedenJohannes Kepler University, AustriaGeorgia Tech, USAUniversity of Washington, USAOhio University, USA},

Abstract = {The platoon control problem for nonlinear vehicles in the presence of time delay is investigated in this paper, where both constant time delay and time-varying delay cases are considered. A linearized third-order vehicle dynamic model is firstly derived by deploying the exact feedback linearization technique and the vehicle platoon control problem is converted into a consensus-seeking problem. Then, a consensus based vehicle platoon control algorithm with time delay is proposed, which drives vehicles to form an equally spaced platoon with the same velocity. By deploying the Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem, the upper bound of time delay for vehicle platoon with constant time delay is derived and the sufficient conditions that guarantee the stability of the vehicle platoon are obtained. Meanwhile, the sufficient conditions that ensure the stability of vehicle platoon with time-varying delay are acquired via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem. Numerical demonstrations verify the feasibility and},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {Automated vehicles are designed to free drivers from driving tasks and are expected to improve traffic safety and efficiency when connected via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, that is, connected automated vehicles (CAVs). The time delays and model uncertainties in vehicle control systems pose challenges for automated driving in real world. Ignoring them may render the performance of cooperative driving systems unsatisfactory or even unstable. This paper aims to design a robust and flexible platooning control strategy for CAVs. A centralized control method is presented, where the leader of a CAV platoon collects information from followers, computes the desired accelerations of all controlled vehicles, and broadcasts the desired accelerations to followers. The robust platooning is formulated as a Min-Max Model Predictive Control (MM-MPC) problem, where optimal accelerations are generated to minimize the cost function under the worst case, where the worst case is taken over the possible models. The proposed method is flexible in such a way that it can be applied to both homogeneous platoon and heterogeneous platoon with mixed human-driven and automated controlled vehicles. A third-order linear vehicle model with fixed feedback delay and stochastic actuator lag is used to predict the platoon behavior. Actuator lag is assumed to vary randomly with unknown distributions but a known upper bound. The controller regulates platoon accelerations over a time horizon to minimize a cost function representing driving safety, efficiency, and ride comfort, subject to speed limits, plausible acceleration range, and minimal net spacing. The designed strategy is tested by simulating homogeneous and heterogeneous platoons in a number of typical and extreme scenarios to assess the system stability and performance. The test results demonstrate that the designed control strategy for CAV can ensure the robustness of stability and performance against model uncertainties and feedback delay and outperforms the deterministic MPC based platooning control.},

Abstract = {The problem of controlling a platoon of vehicles moving in one dimension is considered so that they all follow a lead vehicle with constant spacing between successive vehicles. The stability and the string stability of a platoon of vehicles with two independent and uncertain delays, one in the inter-vehicle distance and the other in the relative velocity information channels, are considered. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) using a simplifying factorization procedure and deploying the cluster treatment of characteristic roots (CTCR) paradigm to obtain exact stability boundaries in the domain of the delays, and (2) for the purpose of disturbance attenuation, the string stability analysis is examined. Finally, a simulation example of multiple vehicle platoon control is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed nonlinear consensus delay-dependent control algorithm for a connected vehicle (CV) platoon. In particular, considering that the behavior of the following vehicle is associated with the longitudinal inter-vehicle gap with respect to the preceding vehicle, a nonlinear function is designed to characterize the car-following interactions between CVs. Then, a nonlinear consensus algorithm is proposed by incorporating the car-following interactions and heterogeneous time delays. The delay-dependent convergence condition of the proposed control algorithm is analyzed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, and an estimate of the delay bound is provided. Under the proposed algorithm, not only can the consensus of CVs be guaranteed but also the behavior of vehicles is consistent with traffic flow theory. Finally, an example using a 10-vehicle platoon is provided under three scenarios: no time delays, heterogeneous time delays, and homogeneous time delays. Results from extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in terms of the position, velocity, and acceleration/deceleration profiles.},

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is one of the promising solutions to addressing the safety, mobility and sustainability issues of our current transportation systems. Specifically, the control algorithm plays an important role in a CAV system, since it executes the commands generated by former steps, such as communication, perception, and planning. In this study, we propose a consensus algorithm to control the longitudinal motion of CAVs in real time. Different from previous studies in this field where control gains of the consensus algorithm are predetermined and fixed, we develop algorithms to build up a lookup table, searching for the ideal control gains with respect to different initial conditions of CAVs in real time. Numerical simulation shows that, the proposed lookup table-based consensus algorithm outperforms the authors' previous work, as well as van Arem's linear feedback-based longitudinal motion control algorithm in all four different scenarios with various initial conditions of CAVs, in terms of convergence time and maximum jerk of the simulation run.},

Abstract = {In addition to decentralized controllers, the information flow among vehicles can significantly affect the dynamics of a platoon. This paper studies the influence of information flow topology on the internal stability and scalability of homogeneous vehicular platoons moving in a rigid formation. A linearized vehicle longitudinal dynamic model is derived using the exact feedback linearization technique, which accommodates the inertial delay of powertrain dynamics. Directed graphs are adopted to describe different types of allowable information flow interconnecting vehicles, including both radar-based sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Under linear feedback controllers, a unified internal stability theorem is proved by using the algebraic graph theory and Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion. The theorem explicitly establishes the stabilizing thresholds of linear controller gains for platoons, under a large class of different information flow topologies. Using matrix eige},
